Examples
Here are some examples of the questions that the AI Medical Assistant can answer:

Postpartum Depression:

Question: "What is postpartum depression? What are the signs and symptoms?"
Answer: "Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that affects some women after giving birth. Signs and symptoms may include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, irritability, and difficulty bonding with the baby. It's important to seek help and support from healthcare professionals if experiencing these symptoms."
Prevention of Infections:

Question: "What should I do to help prevent post-delivery infections?"
Answer: "To help prevent post-delivery infections, it's essential to maintain good hygiene practices. This includes washing your hands frequently, especially before handling the baby or any incision sites. Keep the perineal area clean and dry, change sanitary pads regularly, and avoid using tampons. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for wound care and take prescribed antibiotics if necessary."
Prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis:

Question: "What should I do to prevent deep vein thrombosis?"
Answer: "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, often in the leg. To prevent DVT, it's recommended to stay active and avoid prolonged periods of sitting or lying down. Regularly flex and extend your legs, especially during long periods of travel. Stay hydrated, maintain a healthy weight, and wear compression stockings if advised by your healthcare provider."
Safe Activities in the First Few Days:

Question: "What activities are safe to do in the first few days? Which activities should I avoid?"
Answer: "In the first few days after childbirth, it's important to prioritize rest and recovery. Engage in light activities such as gentle walking or stretching, as tolerated. Avoid heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, or any activities that may strain the healing body. Listen to your body's signals and gradually increase activity levels as you regain strength and energy."
Foods and Beverages to Avoid When Breastfeeding:

Question: "Are there certain foods or beverages I should avoid when breastfeeding?"
Answer: "While breastfeeding, it's generally recommended to avoid consuming excessive amounts of caffeine, as it can affect your baby's sleep patterns. Some babies may also be sensitive to certain foods in their mother's diet, such as spicy foods, citrus fruits, or dairy products. It's advisable to pay attention to your baby's reactions to different foods and consult with a healthcare professional if you suspect any issues."
Physical Recovery from Birth:

Question: "What are some tips for physical recovery from birth?"
Answer: "Physical recovery from birth is a gradual process. It's important to get plenty of rest, eat a nutritious diet, and stay hydrated. Gentle pelvic floor exercises and walking can aid in the recovery process. Take any prescribed pain medications, practice good perineal hygiene, and use warm sitz baths to alleviate discomfort. Don't hesitate to seek medical advice if you have concerns about your recovery."
